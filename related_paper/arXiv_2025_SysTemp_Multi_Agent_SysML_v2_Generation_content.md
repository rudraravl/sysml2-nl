A BSTRACT
The automatic generation of SysML v2 models represents a major challenge in the engineering of
complex systems, particularly due to the scarcity of learning corpora and complex syntax. We present
SysTemp, a system aimed at facilitating and improving the creation of SysML v2 models from natural
language specifications. It is based on a multi-agent system, including a template generator that
structures the generation process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of this system through an
evaluation, highlighting its potential to improve the quality of the generations in SysML v2 modeling.

Introduction

Model-Based Systems Engenieering (MBSE) [1] is an approach that relies on the use of system models (representations
of a system’s components, behaviors, and interactions) for analysis, design, and validation in engineering and systems
development. MBSE is increasingly adopted as it provides a more rigorous, comprehensive, and collaborative approach
to system development compared to the traditional document-based methods. A key driver for MBSE is the fact that
70% of a product’s lifecycle cost is defined during the conceptual phase. MBSE enables systems engineers to capture
system requirements, design, analysis, and verification in an integrated model, rather than relying on disconnected files
and documents. This model-centric approach helps identify issues earlier, improve design quality, and streamline the
development process - overcoming the limitations of the traditional file-based approach that was leading to a dead end.
SysML v11 is the most widely adopted modeling language within MBSE, allowing for the encoding of a wide variety
of diagrams. It provides a rigorous framework for the detailed description of a system model. However, SysML v1
has limitations, including insufficient expressiveness, increasing complexity in managing large-scale models, and
the absence of a standardized textual representation. To address these challenges, the Object Management Group
(OMG) has undertaken the development of SysML v22 . This second version allows for the translation of specifications
expressed in natural language into a formal model, described in a textual notation (see Fig. 1 for an illustrative example).

However, assisting system engineers to write SysML v2 models is complex as (1) the final specification of the language
has not been released as its development is still in progress, (2) there are not many available examples (less than 150),
and (3) while there is an existing parser3 , it does not describe the errors encountered in the model.
Thus, a critical question emerges: how can we assist system engineers in writing SysML v2 models?
Recently, several assistant, based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), have been integrated into various software
environments (such as Visual Studio Code [2] and Photoshop [3]) with the objective of automating repetitive tasks,
providing recommendations, and assisting users to reduce their workload. Following this trend, we plan to assist users
by exploring the challenges associated with translating specifications and instructions formulated in natural language
into correct SysML v2 models, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This preliminary work
shows promises for future integration into a software assistant dedicated to SysML v2 modeling within Siemens Digital
Industries Software.
While LLMs have shown excellent performance in user assistance tools (and other downstream tasks like text generation
[4], translation [5] and code synthesis [6], due to their ability to capture complex relationships within text (and code),
challenges persist in their adaptation to specialized domains with limited or no available data [7]. Techniques such
as few-shot learning [8] and chain-of-thought [9] were developped to tackle these challenges by leveraging LLMs’
remarkable generalization capabilities [10]. However, they do not entirely resolve the issue [11], highlighting the need
for further research into improving LLM adaptability in low-data scenarios. In the case of SysML v2, initial tests4 have
reported poor performance of state-of-the-art closed-source (GPT-4 [12]) and open-source (Llama 3.1-70B [13], Mistral
7B [14], Gemma[15]) LLM models for related tasks.
To overcome this generalisation problem, we have used a multi-agent approach which has been proven to be particularly
suitable for complex tasks [16], as it facilitates the decomposition of the task into subtasks and enable successive
iterations incorporating feedback and compilation signals. Our contributions are two-folds: (1) We propose a multi-agent
system called SysTemp, dedicated to SysML v2 code generation, and (2) analyze its effectiveness on several scenarios.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the background and related work on SysML
v2 generation. Section 3 then provides a detailed description of our model and its architecture. The experiments
and obtained results are discussed in Sections 4 and 5, where we evaluate our approach’s performance on a set of
representative case studies. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the key contributions of this research and identifying
potential improvements and future applications.

Background and Related Work

The automatic generation of SysML v2 models from natural language specifications represents a major challenge in
integrating assistance tools for systems engineering. This problem is similar to code generation in that it involves
converting a textual description into a formal representation usable by modeling tools. SysML v2 relies on a dual
syntax, as shown in Fig. 2: an abstract (and machine-oriented) syntax, expressed in JSON, and a concrete syntax,
in code form, which is closer to human language and more readable. It is possible to translate from the abstract to
the concrete syntaxe with an existing function. The abstract syntax is structured as dictionaries of values and is not
suited for manual manipulation. Automatic handling of SysML v2 is possible through an API5 specified by the OMG.
It is possible, through API calls, to modify an existing model by adding, and/or removing elements. The concrete
syntax6 , resembles traditional programming languages, it is more concise, and it is more understandable by humans.
Consequently, we decided to use LLMs to generate the concrete syntax of a model as it is shorter, thus requiring less
resources to generate and avoiding problems with large contexts [17].

Figure 2: Example of abstract syntax (left) and concrete syntax (right) in SysML v2 – The abstract syntax is the
translation of the concrete syntax but was cropped for readability purposes.
A major obstacle to applying LLMs for SysML v2 generation lies in the lack of suitable training data. Unlike traditional
programming languages, which have extensive annotated corpora and open-source codebases, SysML v2 resources are
limited and heterogeneous7 . From our initial test, even the latest LLMs struggle to generalize effectively for specific
modeling tasks in systems engineering, making generation less reliable and more prone to syntactic and semantic errors.
To date, few studies have combined artificial intelligence with SysML modeling, whether in the initial version or in
SysML v2. Among the existing contributions, John K. Dehart’s work [18] proposes a methodology for the automated
generation of SysML v2 API calls to add, remove, or modify model elements. This approach relies on targeted
API calls to manipulate specific local properties of the generated model. However, their approach requires the user
to have an initial SysML v2 model as input. Thus, a promising research avenue would require the exploration of
alternative approaches, such as integrating multi-agent systems [19] capable of combining model generation with
iterative verification and correction mechanisms.
The adoption of multi-agent systems for code generation via LLMs has grown significantly in recent years, leading
to the development of specialized frameworks such as AutoGen [20]. The AutoGen framework allows to orchestrate
multiple LLM agents specialized in distinct tasks, such as code generation, syntax validation, and optimization. This
methodology is particularly relevant for assisted code generation, where models like PPoCoder [21] or StepCoder [22]
adopt an incremental approach. Instead of producing a program in a single phase, these models decompose the task into
sub-problems and iteratively refine the proposed solutions based on interaction feedback. This iterative structuring not
only enhances the quality of the generated code but also improves alignment with the initial specifications.

This growing interest in multi-agent orchestration for structured generation tasks extends beyond code to include system
modeling. Maria Stella de Biase [23], for example, explores state machine generation through a refinement process that
allows users to iteratively adjust solutions to their specifications.
In this vein, our contribution introduces a multi-agent system augmented by a SysML v2-specific parser and a templatebased generator. By leveraging agent collaboration, conversational programming, and user interaction, we aim to
enhance automated SysML v2 model generation, producing more accurate system models.

Generative Pipeline Based on Specialist Agents

In this section, we present SysTemp, a framework designed to guide an LLM in generating SysML v2 models from
natural language descriptions.
SysTemp is a multi-agent framework, illustrated in Fig. 3, that relies on multiple specialist agents interacting with each
other.
We introduce two key specialist agents that characterize our approach: first, the TemplateGeneratorAgent(TG),
which structures the model by generating a syntactically correct SysML v2 skeleton, and second, the ParserAgent,
which ensures compliance with specifications by detecting potential syntactic errors (e.g. missing parenthesis, missing
semicolumn...)
The ParserAgent and WriterAgent work together in an iterative loop, where the generated model is progressively
refined and adjusted, ensuring conformity to user requirements while minimizing syntactic errors.
Roughly speaking, the generation process unfolds as follows:
1. First, the user provides a natural language description of the desired model, detailing system requirements and
characteristics.
4

SysTemp: A Multi-Agent System for Template-Based Generation of SysML v2

2. This input is processed by the SpecificationGeneratorAgent, which extracts key information and reformats it into a structured Python dictionary.
3. The structured Pytthon dictionary is passed to the TemplateGeneratorAgent, which generates a syntactically
correct SysML v2 skeleton.
4. The WriterAgent uses the skeleton as base and completes it to specify various values (attributes, etc.)
consistent with the user’s needs, producing a completed SysML v2 model.
5. The completed model is then analyzed by the ParserAgent, which detects potential syntactic errors or
structural inconsistencies and forwards them to the WriterAgent.
6. Based on this feedback, the WriterAgent iteratively adjusts the SysML v2 model until it meets the initial
requirements and is free of errors.
In the next section, we formally define the different agents that constitute this pipeline.
3.1

Pipeline’s Agents

The pipeline consists of four agents, described in the following subsections. We consider a single LLM as a nondeterministic function f which outputs a string given a string input. This LLM is re-used for all our agents. In our
agents, the LLM f may be used to either (1) generate the agent’s output directly or (2) provide the input to a tool
t ∈ {P, T } that generates the agent’s output (described below).
3.1.1

SpecificationGeneratorAgent

The SpecificationGeneratorAgent automatically extracts requirements from a natural language specification. It
analyzes the user-provided description to identify key system attributes, structuring them into a Python dictionary for
downstream agents. The SpecificationGeneratorAgent employs few-shot prompting. Namely, For a description
q
or query in natural language for the desired model DN
L , the procedure SpecificationGeneratorAgent outputs a
q
Python dictionary Dict (as a string). An illustrative example of the output is displayed in Fig. 4. Formally, we have:
q
• Input: A natural language specification DN
L,
q
q
• Output: Dict = f (concat(PRGA , Ex, DN L )),

where PRGA is the agent’s system prompt8 , q is the given scenario, k is the number of examples, Ex =
(i)
(i)
concat({(DN L , Dict(i) ) | i ∈ {1, . . . , k}) are few-shot examples, DN L is the i-th natural language specification, and
Dict(i) is the i-th corresponding structured Python dictionary.

" attributes " : {
" power " : " Rated power in watts ( W ) or horsepower ( HP ) " ,

},
" constraints " : {
...
},
" requirements " : {
" Material " : " The bike fork should be made of aluminum . " ,
...
}
}

Figure 4: Specification as Python dictionary obtained from SpecificationGeneratorAgent.
3.1.2

TemplateGeneratorAgent

The TemplateGeneratorAgent is a core component of our approach, responsible for constructing a syntactically
correct SysML v2 skeleton (see Fig. 5) from the structured dictionary generated by the
8

See Appendix A.1.

SpecificationGeneratorAgent. This model serves as a foundation for integrating detailed specifications, yielding
a format-compliant representation of system requirements. Formally, we have:
package BikeFork {
requirement Material
{
doc /* The bike fork should be
made of aluminum . */
}
requirement PivotType
{
doc /* The bike fork should have
a 1 " 1/8 Aheadset pivot . */
}
}

• Input: Dictq obtained from SpecificationGeneratorAgent (see previous sub-section),
q
skeleton
• Output: MSysM
L = T (f (concat(PT GA , Dict ))). Here the LLM is used to provide the input to the tool.

In the above, PT GA is the agent’s system prompt9 , T is a tool that applies a sets of rules10 to Dictq by substituting
placeholders in a template with corresponding values from Dictq . The rules specify the document’s fundamental
structure and syntax. The template tool T follows an expert system approach leveraging the Jinja2 library11 . In this
agent, the LLM’s role is mainly to adapt the input to the tool’s signature.
3.1.3

WriterAgent

The WriterAgent plays a crucial role in the co-construction process by completing the skeleton generated by the
TemplateGeneratorAgent with information from the user’s specifications to obtain a fully specified and SysML
v2-compliant model. By combining the skeleton with user-provided specific data, this agent ensures model adaptation
while maintaining compliance with SysML v2 syntax and principles. Formally, we have:
skeleton
q
• Input: MSysM
L , Dict (see previous sub-sections), and a possible reply r from the ParserAgent (see next
sub-section).
completed
skeleton
• Output: MSysM
= f (concat(PW A , Dictq , MSysM
L , r)),
L

where PW A is the agent’s system prompt12 and r is the empty string initially. Note that PW A includes examples
illustrating the structure of specific elements such as parts, requirements, and other relevant components. The information
provided by the ParserAgent is then used to iteratively correct syntax until it converges to a specification-compliant
version.
3.1.4

ParserAgent

The ParserAgent is responsible for the syntactic and structural validation of the SysML v2 model. Its primary function
is to analyze the model generated by the WriterAgent, identify potential syntax or structural errors, and return a
detailed report E specifying the errors and their corresponding locations within the model. Formally, we have:
completed
• Input: A SysML v2 model MSysM
generated by the WriterAgent,
L
completed
• Ouput: E = P(f (concat(PP A , MSysM
L ))). Here the LLM is used to provide the input to the tool.

In the above, PP A is the agent’s system prompt13 , P is a validation tool that checks whether MSysM
conforms to the
L
formal grammar defining the SysML v2 syntax, as specified by the OMG SysML v2 standard. The parsing mechanism
is implemented in Java. The identified errors E are returned to the WriterAgent enabling iterative correction until the
model fully complies with the SysML v2 specification. In this agent, the LLM’s role is mainly to adapt the input to the
tool’s signature.

Evaluation Protocol for the proposed pipeline

4.1

Evaluating the Structural Role of the Proposed Model

The proposed system is evaluated through an ablation study. We aim to measure the effectiveness of the process with
and without the TemplateGeneratorAgent. In the ablation setup, the system processes a natural language description
without relying on a pre-constructed skeleton.
Formally, without TemplateGeneratorAgent, the WriterAgent is modified as follows:
• Input: Dictq (see previous sub-sections), and a possible reply r from the ParserAgent (see next sub-section).
completed
′
• Output: MSysM
= f (concat(PW
A , Dict, r)),
L
′
14
where PW
A is the agent’s system prompt .

The errors are quantified using a counting function that records the number of syntactic errors detected by the
ParserAgent.
4.2

Data & Models

The study presented focused on five use cases15 described in Appendix. Our examples cover different types of bicycles
(mountain bikes, electric bikes, tires, forks, etc.). For each scenario, an initial request is written in natural language,
and the TemplateGeneratorAgent generates the corresponding skeleton. The scenarios primarily differ in terms of
component types.
For the ablation study, we selected two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, due to their
strong performance across various downstream tasks. Additionally, preliminary experiments indicated that open-source
LLMs significantly underperform in generating SysML v2 models, making their inclusion less relevant for this study.
Moreover, we used k = 3 examples for WriterAgent. Literature showed that a good number of examples is needed to
infer in few-shot prompting.

5

Results

The results in Fig. 6 show the evolution of syntax errors generated by the LLM during the WriterAgent - ParserAgent
loop. A significant difference is observed between the approaches with and without the TemplateGeneratorAgent.
With the TemplateGeneratorAgent, near-systematic convergence is achieved, with syntax being correct and validated
by the ParserAgent in 80% of the scenarios (4 out of 5). In contrast, without a model-skeleton, convergence (or
error-free results at step 5) occurs in only 1 out of 5 scenarios, emphasizing the importance of the initial structuring
provided by the skeleton.
Both models (Claude Sonnet 3.5 [24] and GPT-4 [12]) yield similar results. A slight reduction in the number of errors is
observed with GPT-4. On average, three fewer errors but this difference is not substantial enough to warrant a significant
distinction.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to the automatic generation of SysML v2 models, a modeling language
used in systems engineering. Our approach, based on a structured and iterative multi-agent system, investigates the
feasibility of using GenAI to address the lack of suitable training data.

SysTemp: A Multi-Agent System for Template-Based Generation of SysML v2

Figure 6: Evolution of the number of errors with and without the TemplateGeneratorAgent for five scenarios.
We propose SysTemp, a multi-agent system where we introduce two key agents TemplateGeneratorAgent and
ParserAgent, which respectively create a SysML v2 skeleton and provide feedback on possible syntactical errors in
the generated SysML v2 code.
Our approach primarily focuses on correcting syntax errors in the model, establishing a foundation upon which further
refinements can be built. For instance, future research could explore the semantic quality of generated values. This
could be achieved through an iterative generative process where the user specifies the desired characteristics of their
design.
However, several challenges remain. On the one hand, the semantics of the generated models require further investigation
to ensure the correct interpretation of concepts and optimal alignment with user needs. On the other hand, assessing
the quality of generated SysML v2 models remains constrained by the absence of standard benchmarks, highlighting
the need to develop specific evaluation metrics tailored to this task. We propose investigating the integration of an
LLM-based jury, where multiple instances of the same LLMs are prompted and the most reccurent output is chosen, to
remedy these problems. Additionally, incorporating expert knowledge in the form of ontologies or knowledge graphs
could enhance the coherence and relevance of the generated models. Our pipeline could also be used for synthetic data
generation. Finally, extending this approach to other under-documented modeling languages could further broaden the
applicability of LLMs in systems engineering.
Thus, our work lays the foundation for a new methodology for assisted SysML v2 generation and paves the way for
future developments aimed at strengthening collaboration between artificial intelligence and systems engineers in
advanced modeling contexts.

Templating Rules

The template organizes requirements into packages, where each package groups related requirements. The general
structure is:
package < package_name > {
doc /* This is the package containing the requirements */
requirement < requirement_name > {
doc /* < requirement_description > */
attribute < attribute_name > = < value > < units >;
require constraint {
< constraint_formula >
}
}
}

The specific rules are defined as follows:
• Package Definition: Each package is defined using:
package {{ package_name }} {
doc /* This is the package containing the requirements */

• Requirement Definition: Each requirement inside a package is declared using:
requirement {{ req . name }} {
doc /* {{ req . Description }} */

• Attributes (Optional): If a requirement contains attributes, they are included as:
{% - for attribute in req . Attributes %}
attribute {{ attribute . Attribute }} = {{ attribute . Value }} {{ attribute
. Units }};
{% - endfor %}

• Looping Through Packages and Requirements: The template iterates over all packages and their corresponding requirements using:
{% - for package_name , reqs in packages . items () %}
{% - for req in reqs %}

The final output is stripped of trailing whitespace to ensure a clean SysML v2 code format.
