In addition, it is essential to strictly adhere to the following points:
1.If the smart contract code to be extracted has no obvious logic and it is difficult to generate \
a finite state machine that meets the format, you only need answer [None].
2.When the provided code has multiple smart contract classes, only the last one needs to be processed.
3.Do not output anything extra except for the JSON text of the finite state machine.

2. The logical process of the transition between different stages of the contract and their corresponding states.
3. Main variables, functions, and events.
Try to describe these requirements in concise natural language, and summarize them in [60-150] words! Please imitate \
the following example for output:
\"""
This smart contract is a [voting contract]. The main functions include [creating proposals, voting, and calculating results]. \
The main states of the contract include [Proposal Creation, Voting in Progress, and Voting Ended]. \
The process logic for the transition of states is as follows: [First, create a proposal and initialize the voting options. \
Then, enter the voting phase, allowing users to vote on the proposal. Each address can only vote once. \
After the voting ends, calculate the result and announce the winning proposal. \
After this round of voting ends, proceed to the next round of voting]. \

The main functions include [proposal creation, voting, and ending voting]. \
The main events include [proposal creation, voting completion, and result announcement].
